# Optimization-NBA-Fantasy-Team-
Build an optimization model that takes all 450 current players in the NBA and builds the best fantasy team possible in order to guarantee success in a fantasy basketball league. This model considers each player’s fantasy score, position, salary, team, and more to find whether or not a respective player is the right fit. Additionally, the model also considers which players are best suited to come off the bench as “backup”, when certain players are injured or are not playing.

We collected our data - in-game statistics, player salary, position, etc. - on all NBA players in the 2019-2020 season from Hashtag Basketball and Basketball-Reference. Both websites refresh and update their data logs daily (while the season is ongoing), ensuring data accuracy and reliability. 

# Note:
This project is in progress, will be complete in May 2020
